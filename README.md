## Project Background
### Energy Management 
Energy Management is the process of tracking and optimizing energy consumption to conserve usage in the Industry. Energy consumption by various units are monitored timely and the valuable insights helps in understanding the pattern and hence timely user intervention can save a lot of energy.
### Overview of Beverage Industry
The beverage Industry also known as drink industry is the one which manufactures drinks. It produces alcoholic such as distilled spirits, wine and brewing as well as non-alcoholic drinks such as fruit juices, tea or coffee and other flavored drinks etc.

### Benefits of Energy Management in Beverage Industry
  It increases overall productivity of the manufacturing plant.
  It helps to detect malfunctioning electrical devices timely.     
  It is eco-friendly practice so makes the technology more constructive.

### Aim:
⮚	Main aim of this project is to manage the energy consumption by the overall plant
⮚	To monitor the energy consumption on real time basis by individual plant units and overall plant using IoT sensor.
⮚	To find whether at any instance energy consumption is low or high
⮚	To find whether all the electric motors are working at optimum performance.
⮚	To minimize power losses and overloading

### Business objective:
⮚	Minimize: Energy losses, overloading  
⮚	Maximize: Energy efficiency
Business Constraint:
⮚	To improve the performance of large amounts of data.
⮚	Security of the data and working of the IoT sensor.

### Project Dataset:
Data is collected on real time basis with the help of IoT sensor installed in the various electric motors in each of unit of the manufacturing plant. For every 10 seconds the data of energy consumption by all these individual units is obtained from the IoT sensor.
•	Calculation = ((energy in kWh x 1000)/60 x 60) x 10 
Electrical Energy consumed by individual motors installed in individual unit of the production system acts as independent variables and another meter is installed at the outlet of production system that measures overall electricity consumption acts as a target variable.

The features present in the data are:
